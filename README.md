# Neuroinformatics Pipeline: Decoding Neurological Disorders

This repository presents a comprehensive **bioinformatics pipeline** designed to decode neurological disorders through **EEG signal analysis**, **machine learning**, **genomic integration (GWAS)**, and **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) simulations**. Inspired by projects like Neuralink, this project focuses on open-source, data-driven exploration of brain function and disease.

## 🔬 Statistical Analysis (R)

```r
# scripts/EEG_R_Analysis.R
anova_result <- aov(Signal_Mean ~ Label, data=data)
summary(anova_result)
```

Output saved in `results/anova_output.txt`

## 🧬 Genomics Integration (GWAS)

* 100 synthetic SNPs linked to neurological signal classification.
* Logistic regression results exported as `gwas_results.csv`.

---

## 🧠 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Simulation

* Simulated interpretation of EEG signals into commands:

  * `MOVE_LEFT`, `MOVE_RIGHT`, `STAY`
* Useful in future assistive technology or neurofeedback applications.
